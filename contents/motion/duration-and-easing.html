  <h2>Curve</h2>
  <p>
    A rigidly linear movement looks unnatural to the human eye. Accelerate and decelerate smoothly to help your animation feel more natural.

  <h2>Durations</h2>
  <p>
    Animations should last from 150ms up to 250ms and have to feel quick and responsive. Shorter animations are also more easily compiled by machines, which helps to achieve this feeling.
