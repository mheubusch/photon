  <p>
    Animations should be fast and nimble and never keep the user waiting longer than they need to. The aim is to prioritise user perceived performance over technical benchmarks.
  </p>
  <h2><img src="../images/introduction/notification-16.svg" alt=""> Supportive</h2>
  <p>
    Motion should help ease the user through the experience. It should aid the flow of actions, giving clear guidance for user orientation: spatial or temporal.
  </p>
  <h2><img src="../images/introduction/highlights-16.svg" alt=""> Whimsical</h2>
  <p>
    Animations should have a playful and delightful personality when appropriate.
