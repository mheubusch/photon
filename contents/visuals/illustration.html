  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Illustrations are a visually and emotionally powerful tool. Therefore you should use them sparingly and carefully identify the right situations to use them. If an illustration is used only as a decorative element, it may loose its communicative power and distract people.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use illustration to <strong>encourage</strong> people that are frustrated, or lost. Especially when something has gone wrong. Don't use the illustration if the user is in danger.
